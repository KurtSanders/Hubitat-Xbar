### Features:

* Designed only for use with [Xbar](https://xbarapp.com/dl), Hubitat Elevation®, Apple®  MacOS and Python3.
* Quickly view and control various Hubitat®: 
   * Devices & Sensors
   * Hub Modes 
   * Hubitat Safety Monitor (HSM)

### Overview:
Monitor and control [Hubitat™](https://hubitat.com/) devices, sensors, Hubitat® Safety Monitor, Modes from the Apple MacOS Menu Bar.  This application is controlled via the Hubitat user app named **'Hubitat → XBar App'**.  A Python3 script file is installed locally on the Apple Mac in the Xbar's Application plugin folder (~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins) and configured with your Hubitat OAuth application string.

The Hubitat → Xbar application works with the [Xbar](https://xbarapp.com/dl) as a custom XBar Plugin and is controlled via the Hubitat → Xbar App.  Hubitat → Xbar App **displays** thermostat information, temperature, relative humidity, event-log statistics, contacts, music players, presence devices, locks, lights, and motion sensors.  It can also **control** color control (RGB) device levels, switch/dimmer level devices, locks and also thermostat control via the MacOS menubar.  The Mac menubar icon can be a thermostat reading, contact sensor, lock sensor or switch sensor and upon clicking the displayed state icon, renders more detailed information on all the sensors selected in the App's GUI.

One can click on any controllable Hubitat device, mode or routine in the Mac's Hubitat → Xbar display to invoke the default action for that device, mode or routine.  Non-controllable devices (eg. presence sensors, motion sensors, temperature sensors) can show their event history.

Sensor battery levels can be displayed for devices that have a battery capability by depressing the Apple {option + R} keys as the Hubitat → Xbar menu is activated {being displayed}.

	   * After Xbar install, there should be a 'xbar' in your macOS menubar as shown below <img src="http://xbarapp.com/public/img/xbar-menu-preview.png" width="300">
	   * Set Xbar's preferences as: 
	   		* :heavy_check_mark: 'Start at Login'
	   		* :heavy_check_mark: 'Update Automatically'

* Hubitat© Elevation Hub
	* Launch the **'Hubitat → Xbar App'** on your hub.
	* Configure other **'Hubitat → Xbar App'** user preferences to select sensors, devices, and various display options.
	* Press 'Done' to save your user preferences changes.
	* Select Xbar in the Apple menubar to refresh the Xbar (⌘-R) display to see these changes.

* Xbar's **Hubitat_XBar.5m.py** plugin
	* The Xbar's **Hubitat_XBar.5m.py** plugin is set to automatically refresh Hubitat© sensor values every 5 minutes as the default.  More frequent polling (less than 5 minutes) may adversely impact your Hubitat© hub's performance.  You may wish to change Xbar's **Hubitat_XBar.5m.py** plugin polling frequency in the Xbar's **Hubitat_XBar.5m.py** plugin options screen (⌘-E).
	* The xbar Apple menubar screen display can be refreshed manually by clicking on the xbar logo or displayed sensor icon/value in the Apple menubar, and pressing (⌘-R).
	* Hubitat© sensors/devices which can be instructed to change their state, Hub mode and HPM states can be highlighted and clicked in the Xbar's screen display to change their state.  Xbar will automatically refresh the display screen after a few seconds to reflect the new selected sensor states.  
	* Some Hubitat© sensors/devices may not display a state accurately if they are slow to reflect their state change on the Hubitat© hub.  These sluggish sensors/devices will eventually reflect their correct state in the Xbar display when they are eventually updated on the Hubitat© hub. 

## Application and Plugin Updates
* You must use HPM for all updates to your Hubitat Elevation Hub Apps
* After an HPM update of the Hubitat → Xbar app, you must highlight and copy (⌘-C) each of the following  Apple Terminal commands below and paste (⌘-V) each into the  Apple Terminal screen and press Enter so they execute individually:

	```Shell
	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins
	curl -s -O -J -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KurtSanders/Hubitat-Xbar/main/Hubitat_XBar.5m.py" 
	sudo chmod +x ~/Library/Application\ Support/xbar/plugins/Hubitat_XBar.5m.py
	exit
	```

## Hubitat → MenuBar Emoji Icon Mapping

	* "armedAway"  : ['emoji':"👀", 'color':'red']
	* "armedHome"  : ['emoji':"🏡", 'color':'red']
	* "armedNight" : ['emoji':"💤", 'color':'red']
	* "disarmed"   : ['emoji':"✅", 'color':'green']
* Devices/Sensors
	* "locked"     : ['emoji':"🔒", 'color':'green']
	* "unlocked"   : ['emoji':"🔓", 'color':'red']
	* "closed"     : ['emoji':"📕", 'color':'green']
	* "open"       : ['emoji':"📖", 'color':'red']
	* "off"        : ['emoji':"🟢", 'color':'green']
	* "on"         : ['emoji':"🔴", 'color':'red']

## Issues / Limitations 
1. The Hubitat → Xbar  App is capable of cycling through multiple status bar items.  However, this Hubitat → Xbar  Plugin is designed to only display a ** temperature sensor, contact sensor, lock status, or switch sensor** at the top with the rest of the sensors displayed in the dropdown. 
2. The Hubitat → Xbar  app only allows a selection of one temp, lock, contact or switch sensor or a default 'Hubitat → Xbar ' title.   It is not recommended to use the full sensor name since menubar real estate is top dollar.
3. There is no horizontal alignment supported by Hubitat → Xbar  so it’s all done by character spacing, which means using Apple system monospace fonts for data content. Menlo is the default font, but feel free to change it in the ST Hubitat → Xbar  App in the mobile client Display Options.
4. Selection of a proportional spaced font, pitch and color can be used for all other text areas of the display, like the ST Categories and the ...more... sections.  Be aware that some fonts, colors and sizes may cause the menu to become illegible.  Blank field defaults in the options fields will return the display to normal.
5. Most areas of the menu will accomodate extended ascii character sets, but there might be areas that cannot.  If so, please rename these devices with US ascii characters and send a PM to me on the Hubitat Community Forum.
6. Be mindful of the # of devices selected, event history days/number settings as the Hubitat Hub can be affected by a performance slowdown. 

## Misc Features / Tips
* Hold the Apple ⌥ **Option** key while the Hubitat → Xbar  menu is open to display battery information for devices that can report battery level status.
* The max items per sensor category can be set in Hubitat → Xbar  Output SmartApp Menu Options (if you want to save space but still have access to the sensors)
* Use Apple ⌘R **Command-R** key sequence while viewing the Hubitat → Xbar App menu to **Refresh** Xbar's Hubitat sensors and devices, otherwise Xbar will automatically refresh every 5 minutes (default).
* Use Hubitat Package Manager to keep the **Hubitat → Xbar** application code current.  You must manually download the latest version of the Xbar's python plugin code **Hubitat_XBar.5m.py** following the steps in the [Installation](#Installation) section above.
* **Emoji short-names** are special graphical icons that can be displayed for custom device status.  Please note that these short naming convention is ':xxxxx:' and the name must be entered exactly as they are named on the [Emoji Website Valid Names List](http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/)
* Many other display options are provided and activated in the Hubitat → Xbar App and are either optional or required.
